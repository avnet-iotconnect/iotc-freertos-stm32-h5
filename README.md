# IoTConnect SDK demo based on X-Cube-FreeRTOS for STM32-H5 boards 

![STM32H573I-DK.jp](media/STM32H573I-DK.jpg)

The demo uses the [IoTConnect FreeRTOS RTOS](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-freertos-sdk) 
and provides a sample application to connect [STM32H573I-DK Discovery Kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32h573i-dk.html) to IoTConnect.

The QuickStart Guide below provides a binary image to program the board for quick evaluation of the sample application.
